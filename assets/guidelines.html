<div id="header"><p><center><b>How to read your N Rate</b></center></p></div>

<p>These guidelines are designed to assist producers in selecting a Nitrogen (N) rate that improves profitability when N and corn prices fluctuate.</p>

<p>Maximum return to N (MRTN) is the N rate that will be most profitable for a particular N:Corn price ratio. The MRTN rate is the LARGE number expressed in lb N/acre at the bottom of the screen, and is the total N rate recommended for your field. From this number, you need to subtract the lb N/acre starter you apply and subtract the lb N/acre N credits you take. Below the single large number is the range of N rates that result in profitability within $1/acre of the MRTN rate.</p>

<p>Please see the &ldquo;N Credits&rdquo; screen and the guidelines below for important adjustments to the MRTN rate.</p>

<p><b>Guidelines:</b></p>

<p><li> To determine soil yield potential, consult UWEX publication A2809 or contact your county agent or agronomist.</li></p>

<p><li> To adjust rates for silage, use price ratio that reflects typical prices for N and grain. For maximum silage yield, use N rate for 0.05 nitrogen to corn price ratio. This ratio can be obtained by entering $230/ton fertilizer, 46% N, and $5.00/bu corn.</li></p>

<p><li> If there is &gt;50% residue at planting, use upper end of range.</li></p>

<p><li> If all N is from organic sources, use top end of range. Plus, up to 20 lb N/acre as starter may be used.</li></p>

<p><li> For loamy (medium &amp; fine-textured soils) with &gt;10% soil organic  matter (OM), use low end of range.</li></p>
    
<p><li> For all soils with &lt;2% soil OM, use high end of range.</li></p>

<p><li> For sandy (coarse-textured) soils:
    <br />&nbsp;&bull; &lt;2% OM, use high end of range
    <br />&nbsp;&bull; 2-10% OM, use mid to low end of range
    <br />&nbsp;&bull; 10-20% OM, use non-irrigated guidelines regardless of irrigation status
    <br />&nbsp;&bull; &gt;20% OM, apply 80 lb N/acre</li></p>

<p><li> When corn follows small grains on loamy soils, use the mid to low end of range.</li></p>

<p><li> For loamy irrigated or drained soils, use rates for high yield potential soils.</li></p>

<p><li> If there is potential for carry-over (residual) N, use the low end of range or use the high end and subtract preplant soil nitrate test (PPNT) credits.</li></p>
